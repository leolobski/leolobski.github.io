The main purpose of this website is to contain my CV, which you can find <a href="/files/online-CV.pdf">here</a>. Nothing too exciting to be expected here.

<b>Academic stuff</b>
</h1>
<p>
I'm currently doing a master's degree in <a href="https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/">logic</a> at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/">Institute of Logic, Language and Computation</a> in Amsterdam.
<br><br>
I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Edinburgh; my BSc project can be found here:
<br>
<a href="/files/BSc-project.pdf">Sheaves on Topological Spaces and their Logic</a> (as submitted for assessment),
<br>
and it was supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/">Tom Leinster</a>.
<br><br>
During the summer of 2017, I did a research project in quantum logic and set theory, the outcomes of which are the report
<br>
<a href="/files/summer-project.pdf">The Category of Hilbert Spaces as an Orthogonal Category</a>,
<br>
as well as a series of blog posts explaining quantum logic: <a href="https://andinparticularexists.wordpress.com/">andinparticularexists.wordpress.com</a>. This project was supervised by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cheunen/">Chris Heunen</a>.

<b>Writing</b>
</h1>
<p>
Occasionally, I write for the sake of writing (and thinking). Some of the outcomes of this peculiar process can be found here:

My essay was published in the second issue of the University of Edinburgh Philosophy Society Journal:
<br>
<a href="/files/Philosophy-Society-Journal-2017-18.pdf">Statistical Hypothesis Testing in the Context of Hume’s Critique of Induction</a>.
