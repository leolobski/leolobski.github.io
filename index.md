Welcome to my tiny pool of calm in the whirlwind stream of the information superhighway! I am a logician and a mathematician by education, currently working on a PhD in theoretical computer science.
<br><br>
My research interests include category theory, its applications to the natural sciences, algebraic structures for quantum mechanics and mathematical foundations of quantum computing.
<br><br>
The main purpose of this website is to contain my CV, which you can find <a href="/files/online-CV.pdf">here</a>. Nothing too exciting to be expected here.
