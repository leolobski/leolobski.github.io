<p>
Welcome to my tiny pool of calm in the whirlwind stream of the information superhighway! I am a logician and a mathematician by education, currently working on a PhD in theoretical computer science.
</p>
<p>
My research interests include category theory, its applications to the natural sciences, algebraic structures for quantum mechanics and mathematical foundations of quantum computing.

The main purpose of this website is to contain my CV, which you can find <a href="/files/online-CV.pdf">here</a>. Nothing too exciting to be expected here.
